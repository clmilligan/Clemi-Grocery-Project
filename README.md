# Clemi-Grocery-Project
This program creates a new Node list that allows for a grocery list to be created.

Method Reflection:

The method I created takes the users node input and ensures that it is a valid grocery item
-First i access the file 
-Then i iterates through each item on each line
-I substringed the item
-Then i compare each item to the parameter to see if it is in the file
    -If it is the method returns the item back into the parameters that create the node
    -If it is not in the method it returns none so the node does not have a value
I also created a duplicate method that checks that the imputed node is a value
-It does this by turning each item in the txt file into a node and comparing in with the parameters and if it does not match up then it will return null; otherwise it allows the value to pass
